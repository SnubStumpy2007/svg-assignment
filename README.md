## SVG Generator
The SVG Generator is a command-line tool that allows you to generate SVG images based on user input. It prompts the user for text, text color, shape, and shape color, and generates an SVG image accordingly.

# Prerequisites
Before running the SVG Generator, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js (version 14 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
npm install

# Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the SVG Generator script by executing the following command:

node index.js
Follow the prompts to enter the desired text, text color, shape, and shape color.

Once all the input is provided, the SVG image will be generated and saved as logo.svg in the project directory.

# Customization
You can customize the size of the generated SVG image by modifying the svgContainer.size() method in the generateSVG function in the index.js file.

Feel free to modify the code to add more shapes or customize the positioning and styling of the elements according to your requirements.
